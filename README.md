# Sister City visualizer 

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8.10-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/)

## Description 

This project is a look into visualizing the sister-cities of the world using networkx and pyvis and trying to see if we can gain an interesting insights. I built this mainly because I always found the topic rather interesting but felt there were somewhat insufficient resources when it came to actually visualizing everything. I got some insipiration from [a paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235356930_Not_All_Paths_Lead_to_Rome_Analysing_the_Network_of_Sister_Cities) which analized some of the properties of the sister city graph, but felt like a modern touch would be nice.

Then you should be able to open the jupyter notebook and run some of the codecells to see what happens. 

## Notes 

If you want to expand on this project then I included `make freeze` to save any new deps just for some minor added convenience.
